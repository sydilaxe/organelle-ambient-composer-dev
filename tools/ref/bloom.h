/* Bloom: a long, swelling stereo reverb after the Alesis MidiVerb II "Bloom"
 * programs (45: Bloom 1, 8 s; 49: Bloom 2, 7 s, the same with a pre-delay).
 *
 * The signal flow -- a damped feedback loop through a chain of fifteen
 * diffusing all-pass filters, which is what makes the sound swell instead
 * of starting dense, then three short all-passes per side for the stereo
 * spread -- and its delay times come from the analysis of the MidiVerb II
 * in thement's midiverb_emulator (github.com/thement/midiverb_emulator).
 * This is an independent floating-point implementation; it shares no code
 * with that project.
 *
 * Mono in, stereo out, like the unit. It runs at half Conduit's rate
 * (24 kHz, near the MidiVerb II's 23.4 kHz, with the delays scaled to keep
 * its timing), which also keeps its darker top end. Unlike the exact
 * emulation (midiverb2.c) its decay, size, damping and diffusion can be set. */
